^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Any help or suggestions are welcome.
| This was honestly filling a pain point I've had for a while with source code documentation.
| Sphinx is a great documentation package, and this was my first stab at trying to build an extension.
| If there is a better way to do things or you want to extend the functionality, create an issue or fix and issue a pull request.
